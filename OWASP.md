<h1>OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project</h1>

OWASP Foundation is a global not-for-profit organization established in the year 2001 with the aim of improving security in application software. The organization is sustained by a large number of volunteers, skilled developers, and global cybersecurity professionals, offering open-source utilities, guidelines, and documents, which can be used in identifying and eliminating security issues in applications.

Known OWASP projects include OWASPS ZAP (an open-source utility for scanning security issues in web-based applications), OWASP Top Ten (ten most widely encountered issues in web-based application security), and protective coding cheat sheets.

As volunteer supported, OWASP is driven by various programmers and security specialists worldwide. Educational institutions, government entities, and private organizations worldwide use OWASP resources to enhance their application security and train their staff. The organization also runs local branches, conferences, and training workshops at various levels. It aims to disseminate knowledge regarding cyber security.
