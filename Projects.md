  <h1>Core Resources and Projects</h1>

  <p>
    The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is an international non-profit organization focused on improving the security of software applications.
    It provides widely used documents, tools, and tutorials that help developers and security professionals understand and address application security risks.
  </p>

  <p>Below is a summary of OWASP’s most important projects and tools:</p>

  <h2>1. OWASP Top 10</h2>

  <p>OWASP’s flagship awareness document that highlights the ten most critical web application security risks (latest version: 2021).</p>

  <p><strong>Top 10 Risks:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>A01: Broken Access Control</strong> – Unauthorized access to restricted resources.</li>
    <li><strong>A02: Cryptographic Failures</strong> – Weak or misused encryption methods.</li>
    <li><strong>A03: Injection</strong> – Vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.</li>
    <li><strong>A04: Insecure Design</strong> – Lack of secure design and architectural principles.</li>
    <li><strong>A05: Security Misconfiguration</strong> – Improper configuration or verbose error messages.</li>
    <li><strong>A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components</strong> – Use of unpatched or old dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>A07: Identification and Authentication Failures</strong> – Weak credentials or session issues.</li>
    <li><strong>A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures</strong> – Insecure deployment pipelines or updates.</li>
    <li><strong>A09: Logging and Monitoring Failures</strong> – Inadequate detection and response systems.</li>
    <li><strong>A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</strong> – Servers making unauthorized external requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>A new Top 10 version is expected in early 2025.</em></p>

  <h2>2. OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)</h2>

  <p>
    This project focuses specifically on security risks in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs expose backend services, making them attractive targets.
    The list addresses issues like:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Broken object-level authorization</li>
    <li>Excessive data exposure</li>
    <li>Function-level access control flaws</li>
    <li>SSRF in API contexts</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It serves as a vital resource for teams building or testing modern web and mobile backends.
  </p>

  <h2>3. OWASP Mobile App Security</h2>

  <p>OWASP also supports mobile security through two tightly connected projects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>MASVS</strong> (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard) – A benchmark for mobile app security architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>MASTG</strong> (Mobile Application Security Testing Guide) – A practical guide with hands-on testing procedures for Android and iOS applications. This guide is widely used for mobile app security audits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls</h2>

  <p>
    Unlike the original Top 10, which focuses on risks, the Proactive Controls list is developer-centric.
    It provides ten essential security practices that developers should incorporate during the software development lifecycle (SDLC), such as input validation, secure authentication, and error handling.
  </p>

  <h2>5. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)</h2>

  <p>
    OWASP ZAP is an open-source Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool used to identify security vulnerabilities during runtime.
    It acts as an intercepting proxy that helps developers and testers analyze HTTP(S) traffic and find issues such as XSS or injection flaws.
  </p>

  <h2>6. ModSecurity (WAF)</h2>

  <p>
    ModSecurity is a widely adopted Web Application Firewall (WAF) module compatible with Apache, NGINX, and IIS servers.
    It supports OWASP’s Core Rule Set (CRS), enabling detection and prevention of common web threats by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.
  </p>

  <h2>7. OWASP Cheat Sheet Series</h2>

  <p>
    This series provides concise, high-value guidance for secure coding.
    The cheat sheets cover best practices across programming languages, frameworks, and use cases (e.g., authentication, secure storage, input validation), making them a go-to resource for developers seeking practical security advice.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    OWASP remains one of the most authoritative and accessible sources for application security knowledge.
    Its resources—from risk awareness documents to practical testing tools—are widely used across the industry to improve security in both development and operations.
