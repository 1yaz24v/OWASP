<h1>Core Resources and Projects</h1>

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is an international non-profit organization which aims to enhance the security of software applications. Throughout its existence, it has developed many primary documents, resources, tools, and tutorials designed to assist applicaton security professionals and developers in understanding and managing application security risks. Summarized above are the most important projects and tools from OWASP:

<b>1. OWASP Top 10</b><br>
The OWASP Top 10 is the primary awareness document of OWASP which emphasizes the most critical security issues related to web applications. It’s updated every few years, with the latest version (as of 2021) prioritizing concerns using actual data. The list, from most to least severe, includes:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>OWASP Top 10</strong><br>
    OWASP’s flagship awareness document highlighting the ten most critical web application security risks (as of 2021):
    <ul>
      <li>A01: Broken Access Control – Unauthorized access to restricted resources.</li>
      <li>A02: Cryptographic Failures – Weak or misused encryption methods.</li>
      <li>A03: Injection – Vulnerabilities like SQL injection.</li>
      <li>A04: Insecure Design – Lack of secure architecture principles.</li>
      <li>A05: Security Misconfiguration – Incorrect settings or verbose errors.</li>
      <li>A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components – Use of unpatched dependencies.</li>
      <li>A07: Identification and Authentication Failures – Weak passwords or session flaws.</li>
      <li>A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures – Insecure updates or pipelines.</li>
      <li>A09: Logging and Monitoring Failures – Poor incident detection and response.</li>
      <li>A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – Server makes unauthorized requests.</li>
    </ul>
    A new Top 10 version is expected in early 2025.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)</strong><br>
    Focused on API-specific threats, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Broken object-level authorization</li>
      <li>Excessive data exposure</li>
      <li>Function-level access control flaws</li>
      <li>SSRF in API contexts</li>
    </ul>
    Essential for securing modern web and mobile backends.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>OWASP Mobile App Security</strong><br>
    Includes two key projects:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MASVS</strong> – Mobile Application Security Verification Standard.</li>
      <li><strong>MASTG</strong> – Mobile Application Security Testing Guide for Android and iOS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls</strong><br>
    Developer-focused list of ten essential secure coding practices, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Input validation</li>
      <li>Secure authentication</li>
      <li>Error handling</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)</strong><br>
    An open-source DAST tool that intercepts and analyzes HTTP(S) traffic to find vulnerabilities like XSS and injection.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ModSecurity (WAF)</strong><br>
    A Web Application Firewall module for Apache, NGINX, and IIS, using OWASP’s Core Rule Set to detect and block common threats.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>OWASP Cheat Sheet Series</strong><br>
    Provides best practices and secure coding advice across languages and use cases (e.g., authentication, input validation).
  </li>
</ul>
